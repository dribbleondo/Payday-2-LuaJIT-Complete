Payday 2 Win vs Linux LuaJIT Lua Archive Complete

Based on DorentuZ decompiler from 196 to current

A fork of Steam-test1's Windows LuaJIT Archive, but with linux files merged on top of it.
To use, go to the "Commits" -> then "Update 232.2".

TL;DR: There are a total of 23 changed files (minus this README) between the two ports,
a fair few of which have had extensive coding changes, or otherwise unusual differences
such as a lack of proper discord presence support.

Don't expect this to be updated every patch, because it won't be unless people ask.
